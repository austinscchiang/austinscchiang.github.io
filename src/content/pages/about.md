**Hey! It's Austin. ✌️**

I'm a software engineer at Facebook / Instagram living in Redwood City, California, where I'm making the infrastructure behind its social graph query language more efficient and intuitive.

Previously, I studied software engineering at the University of Waterloo 🇨🇦, interning at Facebook, Uber, Bloomberg and Kik along the way. Understanding complex systems and building clean abstractions upon them pleases me. If you'd like to hear more about my past experience, you can check out my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/austin-chiang-73397558">LinkedIn</a>.

I'm an enthusiasm enthusiast. Hearing others talk feverishly yet _specifically_ about their interests is my favorite thing to do; asking follow-up questions shamelessly is a close second. When I'm able to coalesce my thoughts in written form, I'll jot them down here. You can also catch me reading, playing ultimate frisbee, and trying to broaden my Spotify playlists.

If you need to reach me, the best way to do so is by emailing me at `austinscchiang@gmail.com` ✉️.
